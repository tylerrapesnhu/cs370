#What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
#Computer scientists design or analyze computer systems. This could be related to hardware, software, etc. This matters because so much of our lives, whether personal or professional revolve around computers. Computer scientists are in the background of each system you use. 

#How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
#I approach a problem as a computer scientist by analyzing what is in front of me. If I am working on a program, model, etc. I am looking for what information is already there. If I am fixing something, I am looking to find out where it is broken. If I am building something from the ground up, I am analyzing what needs tobe solved.

#What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
